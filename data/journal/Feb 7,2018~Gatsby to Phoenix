Whow! Today was a crazy day. Started with GatsbyJs and ending with Phoenix. So I started learning GatsbyJs to build a landing page for Goodwork project. Now gatsby suggests GraphQL for using in its data layer. So I decided to learn GraphQL and went to howtographql site and followed the tutorials. Now for examples project they have quite a few option and elixir-graphql one of them. I've tried elixir lang long ago. So i decided to follow that project to also revive my elixir knowledge. So I started following the tutorials and turns out it uses elixir phoenix framework which I don't know at all, but what the heck, I'm gonna learn that too! So I started to follow the tutorial and read the phoenix docs at the same time and thats how I ending my day with phoenix today. Tommorow will be a long day but I'm excited to see where I end up.

So while working on default html5 audio player today I ran into a styling issue. The default audio player can't be styled much. So I have to use javascript to build an audio player to style the way I want and also have to implement all the controls. This is on the TODO list now.

I watched a video on mindmap on youtube which gave me some idea to learn new stuff. So I'm gonna use it to learn german language. Last year I learned a little bit french, but I'm out of practice for quite a bit now. I decided to learn french & german language side by side. I think it'll be interesting to learn two language at once and may actually make it easier to learn. Have to try it. And the mindmap technique will help too.
